## Hangman Game

Simple bowling style Hangman game.

This is a Hangman game where the player is given 12 chances to guess a bowling-themed word by guessing one letter at a time.

## Game Interface

Player can start the game by pressing a letter key on the keyboard to start guessing the randomly chosen word. Blank spaces are then displayed on the screen, along with the letter that the player has guessed. If the letter is in the wrod, the letter will be displayed in the right position, or positions, in the word. If the letter is not, the number of lives will decrease. The player has 12 lives to guess the word correctly. Once the player has either guessed the word correctly or used the 12 lives, the game will automatically chose the next random word. The game keeps track of wins and losses until the player is done playing.
